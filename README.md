# 100PythonProjects
By Wyatt Newell

100 Python Projects is a self-imposed challenge to write 100 Python Projects in 100 days. Ideally this projects should take about a day to complete, and will come from either online sources or ones I develop myself. Each day will be self-contained within a folder marked with the project's name. While these projects are not intense nor very useful alone, this will serve as practice for my future career.
