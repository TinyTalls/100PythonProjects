Image Resizer

The following program is an image resizer. I had a recent problem which required such a program, and I wasn't all too thrilled with the options I had. 
I have not worked with image manipulation in python before, so this will offer a good learning opportunity. 

There are packages already available for such a project. This will help, however my end goal is for the user to have a simple GUI that will allow for input of an image,
resize options, and output path for said image. I would prefer the user not having to write within the python code itself.
